# INF-502
# DNA Sequence Analysis Program

The DNA Sequence Analysis Program is a Python script that allows you to perform various DNA sequence analysis tasks, including calculating the number of matches, finding the best score after shifting, and determining the maximum contiguous chain between two DNA sequences.

## Features

- Set a maximum shift value.
- Input two DNA sequences.
- Calculate the number of matches without shifts.
- Calculate the best score after shifting with a maximum shift value.
- Find the maximum contiguous chain between the sequences.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/anvitha-24/INF-502.git

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

cd INF-502

### Usage

Run the Python script by executing the following command:

python main.py


You will be prompted with a menu to choose your options for sequence analysis.

## Menu Options

1. **Set maximum shift**

   Set the maximum shift value, which is used to calculate the best score after shifting the sequences.

2. **Input DNA sequences**

   Enter two DNA sequences. These sequences will be used for subsequent calculations.

3. **Calculate number of matches (No shifts)**

   Calculate the number of matches between the two DNA sequences without any shifts.

4. **Calculate chain after shifts (Maximum score)**

   Calculate the best score after shifting the first sequence by different positions (up to the maximum shift value) and comparing it to the second sequence.

5. **Calculate maximum contiguous chain**

   Find the maximum contiguous chain in the first DNA sequence compared to the second sequence.

6. **Exit**

   Exit the program.
